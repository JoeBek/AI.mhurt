To all those who are part of the medical dispatch solution,
not part of the problem.

To the expert practice of correct medicine by remote control.

To all telemedics who make it possible.

To the Bell Labs of Dispatch.

And, to the wonderful Mouse Kids.

                                              —JeffJ. Clawson




To the people who answer the phones and send out the
field responders. Your talents and skills are gifts beyond
imagination to countless faceless strangers.

Also to Alison Taggart, my forever best friend.

                                      —Kate Boyd Dernocoeur




To those who are both capable and selfless enough to answer
a plea for help.

To treasured family and friends who provide unending
support.

Also to Derek for years of laughter and dreaming.

    The First, First Responder
    This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding the complex role of the
    Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) as the “first, first responder.” EMDs have
    the potential to make the difference, literally, between life and death, through
    proper application of the principles described in this book. The EMD’s specialized
    skills and equipment can minimize the risks faced by field personnel and enhance
    the quality of patient care.

    This chapter describes the many purposes of Emergency Medical Dispatch. It
    includes the broader historical and anecdotal perspective and research collected
    since this book’s first edition. It also summarizes the reasons the EMD system has
    become the national standard for Emergency Medical Dispatchers.



    Emergency Medical Dispatch is the jewel upon which the
    watch movement of public safety turns.

              Si r:
                      On October 19, 1983 at 2010 hrs. we were dispatched to 450
              Williams Avenue on a choking woman.                   Upon our arrival at 2012 hrs.
              we found Minnie Orr lying on the kitchen floor.                        The report that
              we received was that she was choking and not breathing.                           She had
              choked on a marshmellow which lodged in her throat.                        When we arrived
              we found her breathing normally.


                      Her son informed us that she had stopped breathing and was
              turning blue.        He also stated that he felt that she would have died
              had he not received the instructions that he did from the dispatcher
              for the Fire Department.              Patricia Holt had instructed him over the
              phone in the action of the Heimlich Maneuver.


                      We feel inclined to agree with him and wish to commend Patricia
              for her excellent actions in handling the emergency.                        If you would be

  viders. Once viewed as a good location for
  organizational dumping of sick or injured personnel,
  the up-to-date communication center now enjoys
  increased levels of respect and professionalism.

  Selective prioritization of calls does not equal down¬
  grading of service. True, it may reduce the thrill and
  the drama associated with seeing several emergency
  units roar by. But in the end, it upgrades the quality
  of care in the community in many ways: fewer acci¬
  dents, better understanding of the problem before
  arrival, better preparation by the crews as to what to
  expect, and more enthusiastic crews. They know
  chances are good that their skills are what is needed at
  a particular scene.

  Pressures to hold down the cost of municipal services
  will increase in coming years. Traditional medical care
  has been replaced by a more cost-conscious process of
  managed care. Priority dispatch allows the EMS team
  to not respond reflexively, but with the informed,
  trained capability now within reach of the medically
  trained telecommunication specialist—the Emergency
  Medical Dispatcher.

              Basic Telecommunication Techniques
              Few people are really talented at telecommunication. Even for those who are, it requires
              practice and dedication to organize and process multiple simultaneous tasks. The basic
              roles and responsibilities of an EMD include telephone interrogation, radio dispatch,
              prioritizing responses to emergencies that compete for time and resources, logistics
              coordination among crews at various settings, resource backup, and long-distance life¬
              saving via pre-arrival telephone instructions.

              Dispatch centers vary. Some assign different people to each function; others have
              only one person to perform all functions. Some centers are handled by volunteers.
              Regardless of the setup, the EMD must always strive to behave in the most professional
              manner possible. This chapter outlines basic telecommunication techniques for radio
              and telephone operations. It includes tips for beginners and experienced dispatchers.
              After all, a professional knows there is always more to learn.

              difficult still, to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.

Structure and Function of
Priority Dispatch
This chapter describes the theories and concepts underlying the Medical Priority
Dispatch System™. It is the basic anatomy and physiology, the underlying machinery, of
priority dispatch.

The goal is to provide a clear map of priority dispatch to anyone involved in system
implementation, on-line use, and management. These people need to understand
what EMDs do and why.




Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.

        T     he Medical Priority Dispatch System™ is designed
              to guide the EMD through a predictable, repeat-
              able, verifiable process. This means that every
        caller can rely on consistent assessment and EMS
        response. It also means that patients will receive the
        same level of assistance sent to other, similar situations.
        And if something on the call should go wrong, it is
        possible to verify that the assistance sent was, indeed,
        appropriate. In today’s climate of accountability, these
        are valuable protective mechanisms against certain legal
        liability issues.

        d o understand how such a statement is true, one must
        first understand the anatomy and physiology of priority
        dispatch. Years of evolution and refinement have
        resulted in a misleadingly simple-looking structure that        Fig. 3-1. The EMD has been called the “Air Traffic Controller”

structure is different from Post-Dispatch Instructions.
Pre-Arrival Instructions are scripted in precise lan¬
guage intended to be read verbatim by the EMD.42
This maintains the proper order of care and eliminates
unintentional but critical errors that can occur other¬
wise. Dispatchers working without scripts can too eas¬
ily forget to have the caller check to see if the chest is
rising or if the air is going in before starting chest com¬
pressions in CPR. Regrettably, this has happened.             Fig. 3-30.   The MPDS vl3 protocols. © 1978-2015 PDC.

CHAPTER 3                    STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF PRIORITY DISPATCH   3.37

In most situations, a patient report to responders is not
necessary. In fact, the patient is most often stable
enough to disconnect prior to responder arrival. How¬
ever, because there is no “one size fits all” approach to
call termination, the EMD must evaluate each case
individually and do what is best for the situation at
hand.

Summary

No single component of priority dispatch occurs in a
vacuum. Each depends on the others to link into a chain
of assistance for people needing emergency help. The
flow of priority dispatch, from start to finish, is care¬
fully designed using often subtle but proven principles.
Just as a single part of the human anatomy is difficult to
appreciate in isolation from the whole body, priority
dispatch is best appreciated when the overall anatomy
and physiology of its structure is understood. The pur¬
pose of this chapter has been to introduce all its parts,
some of their functions, and the fundamental under¬
standing of their interactions. The architecture of an
EMD’s successful learning requires a sound foundation
of priority dispatch structural understanding. Problem
and case-specific elaboration will occur in subsequent
chapters of this book.

Dispatch Life Support
Dispatch Life Support is the body of information and methods used by EMDs
to help callers deal with a wide range of patient and scene circumstances. The
scripted protocols enabling this crucial exchange of information lead the EMD
through a verifiable, comprehensive process that eliminates the chance of
inadvertent omissions of vita! information.

The procedures include some variations from hands-on cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. These have been carefully modified and approved by the Academy’s
Council of Standards to enable the EMD to transmit material safely via the unique
telephonic setting.

The Pre-Arrival Instructions found in the current Medical Priority Dispatch System™
(MPDS®) represent a quantum leap in development and design over those
described in the first edition of this book.

 Once the patient has been evaluated and the AED
 placed next to the patient, Z-5 through Z-8 deal
 with removing the patient’s clothing, readying the
 machine, finding the AED pads (electrodes), and
 placing the pads on the patient’s chest. These
 instructions are generic due to differences between
 the various AEDs. For example, Z-6 (Ready
 Machine) reads, “Open the lid, if necessary, and
 press the ‘on’ button, if there is one,” and Z-7 (Find
 Pads) reads “Find the pads (electrodes), and if neces¬
 sary, plug them into the machine.” These instruc¬
 tions are intentionally adaptable due to machine
 differences: one type of machine turns itself on when
 the lid is opened, and others have a lid (or cover)
 that must be opened and an “on” button that must
 be pressed. Similarly, one machine requires the user
 to plug the pads into a socket while the other two
 machines should have the pads pre-plugged. (Plugs        Assisting and Troubleshooting. So let’s assume

Caller Management Techniques
The EMD’s objective is to gain control of each telephone call so the situation can
be handled efficiently—while obtaining the caller’s confidence and conveying a
consistent impression of compassion. Of all the EMD’s tasks, controlling telephone
interrogation can be one of the most trying, but also at times the most rewarding.
This chapter describes a series of predictable caller behaviors that can interfere
with the EMD process and innovative ways to handle tnem effectively.

what is going to happen.

       A major part of this task is dealing with strangers in
       crisis on the telephone.

       After millions of calls in thousands of centers around
       the world, the actions of most callers have been
       analyzed to accurately predict key aspects of caller
       behavior under various stressful situations. It is essen¬
       tial that each EMD understand these behaviors and,
       as a disciplined professional, apply the appropriate
       corrective techniques with strength and compassion.
       This is certainly not a simple task—but done well, it
       is an interpersonal communication art form of which
       EMDs rightfully deserve to feel proud.

                                                                                 A.I.C.D.... 6.11




Medical Conditions
This chapter guides the EMD through an assortment of ailments underlying
priority dispatch decisions and focuses especially on medical conditions. It shares
information about physiology (how the body functions) and pathophysiology
(how the body gets sick); prehospital needs and considerations; and “the pearls”
involved in providing out-of-hospital care for sick people. The specific identification
of the diseases underlying many of these medical problems is difficult to determine
even in a fully equipped hospital.

Learning and applying the concept of priority symptoms (rather than diagnosis)
and mastering the dispatch (rather than EMT, QAO, or paramedic) objectives for
each Chief Complaint is a paramount goal of this chapter.


  When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
  remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

                                 Dear Dr. Clawson,

                                        Dr. Kushner referred your inquiry to me.

                                        For the purposes ot your situation, aspirin is not a blood thinner, in that the
                                 hemostatic defect induced by aspirin is minimal compared to heparin or warfarin. People
                                 who have clinical bleeding on aspirin have an additional underlying hemostatic disorder.
                                 Given that millions of U.S. citizens are routinely taking aspirin or aspirin - containing
                                 products with little or no bleeding, your organization should not place aspirin in the
                                 category with anticoagulants.

Heat exhaustion. This is also not a life-threatening or
time-critical emergency. It is usually a result of over¬
exertion on a warm, humid day and manifests with
flu-like symptoms: paleness, sweating, nausea, and
vomiting. Patients are very fatigued and may have a
headache. Heat exhaustion is alleviated by rest in a
cooler environment and increased fluid intake.

Heat stroke. This condition can be life-threatening. The
body’s temperature regulatory center stops functioning
    and the patient’s temperature soars, as high as 105-108°

    tures can damage the vital organs, especially the brain.
    Heat stroke is typically characterized by red, dry skin and

Safety is the first concern. If there is significant danger,
the caller should be advised to akeep very quiet and stay
out of sight” (X-9). If the patient is violent, the caller
should be advised to observe the patient from a distance
if it is safe to do so, but to "try to avoid any contact
with her/him.” The EMD should advise second-party
(and curious third-party) callers to beware of attack.
The caller should only try to protect the patient from
herself/himself if it clearly appears safe to do so.



Protocol 25: Psychiatric/Abnormal
Behavior/Suicide Attempt
Mental health emergencies vary widely. They include
suicide attempts or suicidal gestures, drug/alcohol abuse
or withdrawal, emotional or hysterical reactions to life’s
events, and normal grief. There is also a wide range of
mental illness, including depression, mania, bipolar dis¬
ease (manic depression), and schizophrenia. Sometimes it
is difficult to distinguish psychological problems from
medical problems; sometimes they go hand in hand.              Fig. 6-15. Suicidal jumper takes rescuer with him. (Photo by

       around the brain), and subdural hematoma (blood clot
       around the brain). Subdural hematoma is a blood clot
       inside the skull, a rigid structure that provides no room for
       swelling without forcing brain tissue into abnormal and
       lethal areas. The cause of bleeding may or may not be due
       to trauma. The blood collects under the dura mater, the
       toughest layer of the three brain coverings. Subarachnoid
       hemorrhage is bleeding into a different layer of the brain’s
       coverings. Finally, stroke is any event—a thrombus (clot)
       or a hemorrhage—that disrupts the supply of blood to a
       part of the brain. Any of these may be lethal or perma¬
       nently disabling. In the past, several of these conditions

Summary
This chapter has presented a brief introduction to
various common emergency medical problems from a
practicing EMD’s perspective. In the next chapter, the
protocols for trauma are presented.

Obviously, the descriptions of the various disease pro¬
cesses are very brief and basic. The intent is to
provide the EMD with a working baseline medical
knowledge about certain emergency conditions, to
explain the reasons for particular interrogation
objectives, and to provide the rationale of various
treatments and response determinants.

While the underlying causes of many of the problems
described in this chapter are difficult to specifically deter¬
mine (diagnose), the EMD does well by carefully follow¬
ing protocol. The objectives of dispatch evaluation are
not those of EMTs, ambulance officers, paramedics, and
physicians—albeit they are similar. The EMD, like the
emergency physician, is rarely the end-point of any
patient’s care. The First Law of Emergency Medicine
clearly applies here.


   First Law of Emergency Medicine
   Anything can happen in emergency medicine
   (and usually does). You don’t have to know
   everything, you just have to know what to do
   with it.


It takes time for an EMS system to shed the habit of
sending a maximal response in many of these situations.
It takes time to see how public safety and Advanced Life
Support availability to the overall community are
enhanced without negative impact to the patient. The
reality of many medical problems (or the prehospital
worker’s ability to influence outcome) is different from
how awful they seem when described by callers.

  Of all the treatments possible, the first to consider
  is to do nothing.

           EMDs were generally great early proponents of
       its use and could directly see the time saved between
       dispatch administration and that later possibly
       accomplished at scene. However, the collective of
       medical directors were all over the board in their
       concerns about dispatchers “practicing medicine,”
       estimates of time saved, and clinical concerns over
       inappropriate use of something widely advertised
       internationally on TV by Bayer as the “pop” stan¬
       dard of care if one suspects a heart attack.

          Largely because of this, the Aspirin Diagnostic
       Tool was limited to be a medical director-approved
       treatment option within the Chest Pain, Breathing
       Problems, and Heart Problems Protocols. Initial
       surveys of hundreds of medical communication cen¬
       ters utilizing this option determined that the initial
       “approval” to use was 68%, which has subsequently
       risen to near 80%.

          In addition, dozens of questions were raised dur¬
       ing and shortly after initiation of this treatment
       option (see pages 6.15-6.23). These questions and
       their answers take up over eight pages in the Prin¬
       ciples of EMD textbook alone. It was estimated, by

Trauma Incidents
Many dispatchers perform their jobs without basic emergency training or practical
experience with emergency medical problems. EMDs, as part of the emergency
medical team, need a special familiarity with medical principles. Murder, mayhem,
and a meaner society places the EMD electronically at the scene of many difficult
and sad situations.

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce information related to this element of
emergency care—trauma (or injury).

This chapter is valuable for EMDs who have training and experience in prehospital
care; it is essential for those who do not. Information is presented from the
dispatcher’s perspective, not that of field personnel. There are important
differences.


When you’ve confused, beat up and hurting, nothing feels as good us some
calm, capable, credible, concerned person paying attention.

      in either worsened bleeding (because the venous flow is
      shut off but arterial flow is not) or in tissue damage to
      the limb.

      There had been, in the past, some confusion regarding
      the previous advice in X-5 “Do not use a tourniquet.”
      This was meant only to advise not putting one on ini¬
      tially. This has now been removed from these instruc¬
      tions. In addition, the related CEI has been modified as
      shown, adding, “If asked about applying one, tell them
      to do what they think is best.” It should now be clear
      that if bystanders have already applied a tourniquet, the
      EMD should not interfere, since removing it could rein¬
      itiate uncontrollable bleeding.

      A new paradigm in the lay use of tourniquets is being
      openly discussed in several medical circles, including the
      National Security Council at the White House, that will
      very likely change the previous warnings not to apply one

   different equipment must often be carried
   long distances to the site.


When given a vague Chief Complaint like, “We have
just had a major collapse," the EMD must remember
to clarify the initial description, e.g., “Sir, this is very
important. Tell me exactly what happened." The
intent is to have the caller describe the events they
have witnessed, or have been told about. The EMD
can then make an informed decision regarding the
most suitable Chief Complaint within the protocol.
All of this information helps to provide an accurate
size-up for the responders charged with the rescue and
stabilization of the incident.

Time-Life Priority Situations
Critical priorities are estimated by outcome to be about 5 to 10 percent of the emergencies
that are telephoned in to EMS systems. That adds up to a large number of people worldwide
needing time-critical or lifesaving assistance every year. The Medical Priority Dispatch
System™ (MPDS®) identifies nine situations in which a problem poses an immediate time-
critical or life-risk possibility to the patient. Some are medical in nature; others are due to
trauma.

Time- or life-critical calls represent some of the closest emotional ties the EMD will have with
callers. This can generate a lot of pride—but sensations of frustration as well. Clearly, priority
dispatch (especially Dispatch Life Support) has an impact on patient survival. The EMD can
make a difference! However, there are losses. In cardiac arrest of all types, the average save
rate is less than 1 in 10. To win is to beat the odds! The EMD should not expect to save every
life. Priority dispatch provides the potential to save lives but does not guarantee success every
time. EMS is a best-efforts ball game; the win/loss score must not be allowed to define the
quality of those efforts.

Protocol 9: Cardiac or
Respiratory Arrest/Death
This protocol serves as a buffer between
the Case Entry Protocol and Pre-Arrival
Instructions. Cardiac arrest and respiratory
arrest are clearly time-critical events. The
following rules embody one of the most
important concepts in prehospital care.

The EMD knows during Case Entry inter¬
rogation that the Chief Complaint is critical
when the answers to “Is he breathing? and
“Is s/he awake?” are a panicky, terror-stricken
“No!” When the EMD asks what the main
problem is, answers will range from “I think
s/he’s dead!” to “I can’t get her/him to wake
up!” Even before turning to Protocol 9, the
EMD sends a maximal response because
breathing and consciousness are absent. In        Fig. 8-3.   After dragging her motionless, non-breathing husband nearer the phone,

           A submerged patient, regardless of time
           underwater (< 6 hours), is considered
           resuscitatable by definition until proven

        In some cases, the patient may not even yet be discon¬
        nected from the power source. Certain currents of
        electricity cause muscles to contract; if the patient’s
        hands are grasping the power source (such as a bare
        wire), this could cause them to contract more tightly
        around the wire itself. If disconnection has not
        occurred and the power has not been turned off, sig¬

        The EMD will need to know whether the patient is

Scenarios & CDE
In this chapter, each of the various types of Chief Complaint Protocols is demonstrated in
full, from Case Entry (initial assessment), to Key Questions (ongoing assessment), through
dispatch of resources, and, where applicable, to Dispatch Life Support, and ultimately to case
completion.
The protocols chosen for demonstration are as follows:

  1. The Trauma protocol, 7: Burns (ScaldsJ/Explosion (Blast).

  2. The Medical protocol, 23: Overdose/Poisoning (Ingestion).

  3. The Time-Life protocol, 31: Unconscious/Fainting (Near).

  4. The SHUNT protocol, 22: Inaccessible Incident/Other Entrapments (Non-Traffic).

The Academy’s method of continuing dispatch education (CDE) is highlighted.

                                . The problems often cited
       are legendary and include scheduling problems, the
       low priority of dispatcher education in public safety,
       and, not least, cost. The double four-letter word—over¬
       time—is always an issue. Until emergency dispatchers,
       across the board, are given educational parity with other
       public safety personnel, the ability for these emergency
       practitioners to maintain their skills and efficiency will
       continue to suffer, while placing their systems at an
       increased level of risk in this “risky business. ”

       CDE is one of the eleven essential elements of quality
       management in dispatch. Taking all this into consid¬
       eration, in 1998, the International Academy set into
       motion a plan to create a type of CDE that minimizes
       the usual problems anticipated by management. By uti¬        fig. 9*2. A screen from the “MPDS® Sick Person (Specific

       Summary
       Priority dispatch is composed of many discrete
       parts. These scenarios are intended to provide a learn¬
       ing forum for “putting it all together.” The pathway
       that each case takes is always unique; there were innu¬
       merable moments when each scenario could have
       taken a different turn, based on many “what if?” pos¬
       sibilities. Real-life experience with the system, when
       understood and mastered, should be even more fun
       and rewarding. The professional EMD never stops prac¬
       ticing and learning.

Stress Management in Dispatch
Chapter Ove
Dispatching is very stressful work. Anyone who has done it knows vividly how the
hot seat feels. Shifts that begin with a bang and never slow down can leave the
EMD feeling drained and slightly bruised, if not totally battered. On the other hand,
in slow times, waiting hours for a call can be hard in its own insidious way.

This chapter addresses stress and its negative effects. It focuses on the stressors
unique to the dispatch office and offers the EMD an understanding of the way
stress can build to unhealthy levels.

It also describes various strategies to recognize and cope with stress. Half the
battle is learning to admit that over-accumulations of stress exist. The other half is
learning to manage stress appropriately.

Symmetry
The job of an EMD varies widely from place to place.
Some EMDs handle relatively few calls and tasks are
relatively low pressure. However, these EMDs often
have the stress of knowing the people involved. Other
EMDs are extremely pressured and constantly receive
and process what seems to be the worst and most
bizarre events society can generate. Stress and distress
are inevitable in modern daily life. However, the far
end of the distress spectrum, burnout, is completely
preventable ifone is honest with self-appraisal and in
managing personal stressors.

Not everyone is suited to be an EMD. For some, it is
just too stressful. The addition of providing compas¬
sionate Dispatch Life Support may be a difficult
adjustment for long-time dispatchers to make. Those
not suited to be competent, modern EMDs should
realize this unhappy fact and move on to do something
they enjoy. This is for the sake of self, the agency, field
colleagues, and the public. People without enough

Legal Aspects of EMD
        TMjJL#J^33l                       Wmm

This chapter summarizes legal issues surrounding EMD and the Medical Priority
Dispatch System™ (MPDS®). First, a common framework is provided through
the presentation and definition of relevant legal terms and principles. Certain
areas of medical dispatching that have tended to attract legal attention, “dispatch
danger zones,” are presented in full, along with recommendations for minimizing
vulnerability to lawsuits. Several hallmark legal case call transcripts are presented
and evaluated.

Since the inception of priority dispatch, many states have generated regulations,
certifications, and immunity statutes in support of the concepts that have evolved into
the standards of priority dispatch and Dispatch Life Support.

The point is, while your dispatching personnel express anxiety over the possibility
of liability for providing such a service, we may well see the day when a
municipality faces allegations of negligence for not providing such a service.

    a maximal response, provided the system emphasizes
    to the caller to call back if the situation changes before
    help arrives (see Appendix C).

    Secondly, with rare and approved exceptions, every
    call for help should be evaluated by an appropriately
    trained, out-of-hospital care provider or team.

    Priority dispatch is not a process of screening out some
    callers so they get no help at all. Basic Life Support pro¬

    of the cases, emergency fire department responses were
    not necessary and were safely eliminated. Instead, the
    private ambulance company, with both Basic Life Sup¬

    majority of alpha calls safely, successfully, appropriately,
    and alone?

       Quality Management
       This chapter reviews essential functions that constitute a comprehensive
       and effective quality management program. Unlike various other EMD
       programs that may include training and the discretional use of a set of
       interrogation guidelines, priority dispatch is a structured systems approach
       to Emergency Medical Dispatching. Priority dispatch includes the most
       advanced quality management process in EMD as well as in EMS and
       public safety in general.

     performance feedback to the EMDs, the quality man¬
     agement cycle is complete. T he remaining activities
     that are related to making changes to the protocols
     occur in conjunction with the Academy.

     One of the most powerful features of priority dispatch
     is its use of a “uniform protocol.”146'147 The inability
     of users to “customize” the protocol does not mean
     that the protocol is stagnant in its evolution. Since
     its inception, the protocol has had more than two
     thousand changes to its design, content, and syntax.
     Changes to the protocol result from the submission of
     “Proposal for Change” (PFC) forms (see page A. 9) that
     users send to the Academy. The Council of Standards
     carefully reviews each request and evaluates support¬

  evaluation process and sense that their views will be
  respected. On a larger scope, when there is a formal
  recommendation for protocol improvement made
  by seasoned, well-trained EMDs, supported with
  proper data, a process of evaluation and approval is
  then conducted by the Council of Standards within
  the Academy’s College of Fellows. This scientific,
  uniform process allows for continual refinement
  and improvement of the protocols.

   These improvements are then implemented by all
   centers using the unified system. This maintains
   consistency while sharing valuable improvement
   among all “users.”
 r/n Evolution of EMD
The genesis of EMD processes used by medical dispatchers to interrogate callers and
determine the need for Dispatch Life Support and system response was occurring in
several locations simultaneously in the 1970s.' At that time, new pressures resulting from
increased availability and use of 9-1-1 in the EMS and public safety environment served
as the catalyst needed to change inefficient and unsafe dispatch practices. The growing
demand for modern emergency medical services has continued to fuel this process.

This need to evolve has effectively called the question to choose between either a
disarrayed, every-system-for-itself future versus a unified standard. Using a scientific
method-based evaluation and change process, the International Academy of Emergency
Medical Dispatch® grew to manage a full range of medical dispatch standards as the
preeminent professional organization for EMD worldwide.

         I n the mid-1980s, the city of Detroit began a well-
            funded city-wide advertising campaign to jolt public                      EMS Dispatching
            awareness not to call 9-1-1 unless a true emergency                              Its Use and Misuse
        existed. After billboard, radio, and television ads were
        run, the outcome was an unpleasant surprise to both the
        politicians and public safety officials. Calls to 9-1-1 rose
        more than five percent!

        In the late 1970s, the Dallas Fire Department tried a
        different approach to managing the increasing 9-1-1
        call volume. Assistant Chief Bill Roberts issued a white
        paper, “EMS Dispatching—Its Use and Misuse.”149,150
        This document identified that the dispatch center was
        central to the appropriate management of emergency
        calls and that if the determination of 9-1-1 problem
        severity could be safely accomplished, calls could be
        successfully “triaged” (see fig. 13-1).149,150

                                        The result was the

        Pluralizing the Academy: Formation of the expanded “Academies of Emergency Dispatch”

        On the final morning of Navigator 2000, Dr. Jeff Clawson, founder of the International Academy of EMD
        and the MPDS, used the forum of the conference general session to announce a major expansion of
        the Academy s mission. With the introduction of the fire protocol, and with law enforcement protocols
        emerging, the Academy s mission was modified “To conduct an ongoing review of the current standards of
        care and practice in EMD, Fire, Police, and other areas of public safety telecommunications and to evaluate
        the tools and mechanisms used to meet dr exceed those standards.”

        With that in mind, the International Academy of EMD was pluralized to form the expanded International
        Academies of Emergency Dispatch. The IAED is comprised of three allied Academies with related programs
        and standards for Medical, Fire, and Police dispatching. Each Academy is formed from distinct boards and
        councHs and staffed with experts from their respective fields, which allows them to embrace all elements of
        public safety, while continuing to provide outstanding, personalized service to each group.

        ^"°on!loCt ar)n comP*'ment t)ie change in the Academy, Medical Priority Consultants, Inc., also evolved early
        in 2002 to allow for the addition of the fire and law enforcement protocols. Now known as Priority Dispatch
        Corp, it oversees the graphic and computerized application of these new protocol logic programs as well as
        managing training and instruction development for each discipline.

           RE:    911   Professional   Liability Coverage

           Dear

           Thank you for your assistance on the application for 911 liability
           coverage.   I have heard back from the insurance company
           underwriter and am sorry to report that a coverage quotation will
           not be forthcoming at this time as your system does not currently
           give pre-arrival medical instruction to callers needing this
           service.   The company has in the past been made aware of
           situations where the caller requested medical advice, and was told
           that was beyond the system capabilities.   The resulting worsened
           condition quickly turned into a liability claim against the system
           operators.   It seems the currently running television shows
           depicting 911 situations which include pre-arrival instruction
           have caused the general public to expect this service from all 911
           operations.

           I understand that the plans are for this to be implemented soon.
           I strongly encourage that action and will be more than happy to
           resubmit your system for quotation consideration upon the
           implementation of this service.

           Thank you      for your continued assistance     and please   let   me     know of
           your time      frame when decided.

           Sincerely,

                           To:             All Fire Department Personnel
                           From:           Tom Tallon, Fire Chief
                           Subject:        Fire Department Response On Bravo Calls
                           Date:           23 December, 1997


                                  For over a year now, the Salt Lake City Fire Department has been
                           evaluating our response and subsequent treatment of Bravo level EMS calls
                           within Salt Lake City. Our research has shown that the time savings we realize
                           for these calls does not outweigh the danger of responding in a lights-and-siren
                           mode. The fact that 52.3% of lawsuits against EMS agencies are produced by
                           Emergency Medical Vehicular accidents certainly points out the inherent dangers
                           surrounding 10:39 responses. Now that our dispatch center is one of only 15
                           Accredited Centers of Excellence worldwide has bolstered our confidence that
                           we can change our responses to previously identified EMS situations.

                                   Given this information, on Thursday, January 01, 1998, our Department
                           will respond to all Bravo calls in a non-lights and siren (10:40) mode. In this
                           matter, we hope to increase safety for our firefighters and citizens alike. The
                           Officer in charge of the apparatus may, at their discretion, respond 10:39 if they
                           feel patient care and/or safety dictates a Plot response. Some of the situations
                           which may warrant a lights-and-siren response would include; environmental
                           conditions, dispatch updates which indicate condition changes, exaggerated out
                           of district responses, or extreme border responses within given district. We ask
                           for your continued support in evaluating this new era of EMS response in our
                           community. We are the first department in the country to implement a measure
                           as bold as this. If you begin to see problems, please contact your Battalion Chief
                           with a feedback report.

                                                     CHD mortality over the last 30
       years. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute estimates that as many as
       1.25 million people will experience an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 1993,
       and nearly 500,000 will die.
             The importance of early treatment has been underscored in the last decade
       with the results from clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy demonstrating
       mortality reductions with earlier treatment. Out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death
       is an ever-present threat, further highlighting the importance of early recognition
       and treatment.
             However, a fundamental barrier to timely treatment is delay—at the level of
       the patient, the emergency medical services (EMS) system, and the emergency
       department. In June 1991, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
       launched the National Heart Attack Alert Program (NHAAP) with the goal of
       reducing AMI morbidity and mortality, including sudden cardiac death. The
       NHAAP Coordinating Committee was formed to help develop, implement, and
       evaluate the program. This committee is composed of representatives of 39
       national scientific, professional, governmental, and voluntary organizations
       interested in lowering AMI morbidity and mortality through professional, patient,
       and public education.
              The importance of the EMS system for cardiac care has been highlighted in
       the American Heart Association’s recent guidelines for cardiopulmonary
       resuscitation and emergency cardiac care where early access to EMS is identified
       as the first link in the chain of survival for cardiac arrest. The chain of survival
       concept has been expanded to include patients with symptoms and signs of AML
              Emergency medical dispatching has been recognized as a vital part of the
       early access link in the chain of survival for cardiac arrest. The potential
       important role for emergency medical dispatchers (EMD’s) in the prehospital care
       of patients with symptoms and signs of an AMI, as well as patients with cardiac
       arrest, is the underlying assumption of this paper.
              Thus, while emergency medical dispatching is a broader topic than AMI and
       cardiac arrest, this paper represents a consensus of its potential contribution to
       the seamless prehospital identification and treatment of patients with AMI,
       including cardiac arrest, as well as a consensus of the critical issues and
       recommendations for medical dispatch protocols, processes, training and
       certification, and quality control and improvement.
            Nevertheless, it should be noted that there is a paucity of research related to
       outcomes associated with emergency medical dispatching. Only through
       evaluation research can the optimal EMD processes and protocols, associated
       with specified outcomes, be elucidated.

                                                                                           TO EMERGENCY
                                                 survival includes four links, each
    of which must be robust to ensure maximal survival rates.2 The components of
    the chain are:
                                                                                                  MEDICAL

                                                                                              DISPATCHING
         2. Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), either by bystanders or first-
            responder rescuers

         3. Early defibrillation by first responders, emergency medical technicians, or
            paramedics
         4. Early advanced life support.

         Although the chain of survival was initially conceptualized for cardiac arrest
   victims, patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) also benefit from the
   chain-of-survival approach to emergency cardiac care in the community.3
         The first link of the chain of survival (early access) encompasses several
   major actions that must occur rapidly. Among these are recognition of the
   symptoms and signs of the AMI by the patient and bystanders, notification of the
   EMS system (often by use of the 9-1-1 emergency telephone number), recognition
   of a cardiac emergency by the medical dispatcher, and activation of available EMS
   responders. Each action is a part of the early access link.2
        During the past 15 years, the public has been educated to use the 9-1-1
   emergency telephone number to summon help for a range of emergencies, from
   minor problems to life-threatening conditions.3’4 The value of the 9-1-1 system is
   probably increased if there is a qualified professional—the emergency medical
   dispatcher (EMD)—to process emergency medical calls.2,5
         An EMD is a trained public safety telecommunicator with the additional
   training and specific emergency medical knowledge essential for the efficient
   management of processing 9-1-1* calls and other emergency medical
   communications.6 EMD’s can perform some important functions that may
   enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of prehospital care for AMI patients.
   They can elicit symptoms from callers to determine if a heart attack is possibly
   occurring7,8 and activate appropriate EMS responders to deal with the
   AMI patient.9 Dispatchers can also provide 9-1-1 callers with instructions for
   how to care for the possible AMI patient until help arrives—including CPR, if
   necessary.7,10'16 Effective emergency medical dispatching has the goal of sending
   the right EMS resources to the right person, at the right time, in the right way, and
   providing the right instructions for the care of the patient until help arrives.
         This goal can be ideally accomplished through the trained EMD’s careful use
   of a protocol that contains the following elements:6,17,18
         1. Systematized caller-interrogation questions that are chief-complaint

                       4. Referenced information for dispatcher use.
                       The impact of well-trained, medically managed EMD’s on the early care of
                  potential heart attack victims is believed to be potentially beneficial. Five
                  elements seem to be key to an effective emergency medical dispatch program:
                        • Use of medical dispatch protocols
                        • Provision of dispatch life support (see definition below)
                       • EMD training
                       • EMD certification

                       • Emergency medical dispatch quality control and improvement processes.
                        This paper discusses each of these elements and makes some
                  recommendations for improving emergency medical dispatching in the United
                  States. Local, county, and State governments have a responsibility to ensure that
                  9-1-1 and emergency medical dispatch centers are staffed by qualified EMD’s.
                  This involves including emergency medical dispatching as part of a community’s
                  assessment of its EMS needs, and designating resources that are indicated, to
                  serve the welfare of its citizens.

      • The National Association of EMS Physicians’ (NAEMSP) position paper,
        “Emergency Medical Dispatching.”17                                                      MEDICAL
      The recommendations set forth in these documents are believed to be
 appropriate, and all EMS systems are encouraged to implement them as much                  DISPATCHING
 as possible. Rather than repeating or superceding the points made in those
 documents, this paper addresses emergency medical dispatching issues with
 an emphasis on care of the AMI patient and reiterates the recommendations that
 are relevant for an emergency medical dispatching system to effectively handle
 the AMI patient.
     The ASTM is also currently developing two additional documents on
 emergency medical dispatching. It is anticipated that these standards will parallel
 many of the recommendations contained in this paper. These documents are:
      • The ASTM F-1552 “Standard Practice for Training, Instructor
         Qualification and Certification Eligibility of Emergency Medical
         Dispatchers”19
      • The ASTM F-1560 “Standard Practice for Emergency Medical
         Dispatch Management.”20
       It should be noted that few well-constructed, objective, published studies
 exist that address the components or the effectiveness of components of
 emergency medical dispatching. This is in large part due to the difficulty in
 defining, as well as determining, those patient outcomes or improvements in
 patient conditions that are a result of emergency medical dispatching. The
 patient’s condition can deteriorate during the time it takes a prehospital provider
 to arrive at the scene. Outcome parameters based on the EMS personnel’s initial
 patient findings are not well defined for most prehospital problems other than
 cardiac arrest and critical trauma. To guarantee that outcomes actually result from
 the use of a given protocol, a study must demonstrate high compliance to that
 protocol by the dispatchers. Studies must clearly identify the exact protocol or
 specific part of the protocol that is undergoing evaluation. The need for further
 studies regarding the training and retraining, quality control and improvement of
 EMD’s, and the benefit and optimum configuration of prehospital EMD protocols
 is a general recommendation of this paper.



 Medical Dispatch Protocols
      Effective EMD practice is based on the consistent use of medically approved
 dispatch protocols. These protocols are a written system of procedures for the
 evaluation of, response to, and provision of care to emergency patients.13 A
 written dispatch protocol system directs the EMD to complete a chief-complaint-
 specific, preplanned interrogation of the 9-1-1 caller to accurately assess and act
 on the medical emergency.6 A dispatch protocol requires the EMD to interrogate

                  problem of the patient and to determine the status of consciousness and
                  breathing. This is followed, when appropriate, by a more specific systematized
                  interrogation related to the reported general medical problem, selected by the
                  EMD from among protocol choices that cover all possible presenting medical
                  emergencies. Systematized interrogation is an essential component of a
                  comprehensive medical dispatch protocol, even for those systems not prioritizing
                  between advanced life support (ALS) and basic life support (BLS) calls.5
                        The dispatcher interrogation process has four important purposes:
                       1. Provide the EMD with the information needed to make a correct decision
                          regarding initial unit response, including type of EMS personnel required
                          and use of lights and siren

                       2. Enable the EMD to determine the presence of conditions or situations
                          requiring prearrival instructions
                       3. Enable the EMD to provide responders with prearrival information for
                          planning of, and preparation for, on-scene patient care activities
                       4. Assist in ensuring the safety of the patient, the responders, the caller, and
                          other bystanders.
                        Use of a medical dispatch protocol helps the EMD to avoid making a faulty
                  “diagnosis” of the medical emergency and incorrect dispatching decisions. When
                  EMD’s fail to use medical dispatch protocols, they may be prone to make an
                  assessment of the situation based on inadequate information. The EMD may fail
                  to identify the patient’s chief complaint and, therefore, may provide inadequate
                  response or advice. EMS literature provides many examples of the adverse
                  outcomes and legal problems arising from such faulty dispatch practices.21,22
                        The issue of patient and bystander denial of or inability to recognize heart
                  attack symptoms is commonly encountered at dispatch.13
                        Medical dispatch protocols should include standardized response
                  classifications based on the EMD’s structured assessment of the medical urgency
                  of the incident and indicate the level of EMS response needed. These response
                  classifications should be based on recognized medical symptoms and the type of
                  incident.9,23'25 In systems that vary levels of response, dispatch protocols should
                  specify which situations require an ALS versus a BLS response. This is important
                  in those EMS systems that are “tiered” and allow rapid response by a level of EMS
                  personnel appropriate for the seriousness of the emergency as determined by the
                  EMD (e.g., ALS personnel are dispatched for life-threatening emergencies).
                  Medical dispatch protocols may also specify which situations require a lights-and-
                  siren response to the scene and which do not. With EMS vehicle-related
                  accidents in the United States reported to have been 2,400 for ambulances in
                  1990, it is medically unsound and managerially unsafe to require lights-and-siren
                  response on all incidents.27'29
                        Response classifications will vary from one EMS system to another based on
                  the type of system resources, response limitations, traffic patterns, and geography
                  of their service areas. Response configurations often become more complex for
                  larger or more sophisticated systems.23'25 It must be stressed that decisions
                  regarding response assignments are a responsibility of medical management and
                  should be subject to the approval of the medical director of an EMS system.6,11,12
                       Ideally, standardized response classifications should be based on a uniform
                  coding system. This would assist in consistency of use, statistical comparison,

   and scientific research across EMS systems that use the same medical dispatch
   protocols.9
         The non-English-speaking caller poses an ever-increasing challenge for
   many dispatch centers, especially those in large urban centers. This issue has •
   three basic solutions: 1) sufficient staffing of EMD’s with multilingual capability
   where a center’s constituency has demonstrated frequent use of a particular
   language or languages other than English; 2) secure access to a language¬
   interpreting service such as that provided by one of the major long distance
   carriers; and 3) provision of medical dispatch protocols in commonly encountered
   languages. At the time of publication of this paper, alternate language versions of
   protocols used in the United States are available in Spanish, French, and German.
        It is recommended that emergency medical dispatch protocols:
         • Be medically approved
         • Be uniform throughout each EMS jurisdiction
         • Use standard response classification codes to facilitate scientific
           comparison and study among systems using the same protocols
         • Be followed consistently and nonarbitrarily by all EMD’s, except when
           additional clarification is needed
         • Delineate the types of cases requiring an ALS versus a BLS response
           (especially in tiered systems) and the types of cases requiring use of
           lights and siren from those that do not.



   Dispatch Life Support
         Dispatch life support encompasses the knowledge, procedures, and skills
   used by trained EMD’s to provide care through prearrival instructions to callers.
   It consists oi those BLS and ALS principles that are appropriate for application by
   EMD’s. Dispatch life support forms the basis for establishing the content and
   application methodology for prearrival instructions used by medical dispatchers.30
   The NAEMSP17 has also defined dispatch life support (see the definitions that
   follow).
         Prearrival instructions differ from the less well-specified telephone aid, and
   the differences between them form the basis of recommendations for
   standardization of EMD training and practice (including dispatch life support):
         Prearrival Instructions. Prearrival instructions are medically approved,
   written instructions given by trained EMD’s to callers that help provide necessary
   assistance to the victim and control of the situation prior to the arrival of EMS
   personnel. Prearrival instructions are read word for word by the EMD to the
   fullest extent possible.
        The necessity to routinely provide prearrival instructions has been
   addressed by the NAEMSP: “Pre-arrival instructions are a mandatory function of
   each EMD in a medical dispatch center. . . .Standard medically approved
   telephone instructions by trained EMD’s are safe to give and in many instances
   are a moral necessity."1   The failure to provide prearrival instructions., when
   possible and appropriate, is currently being litigated in the Nation's courts as a
   form of dispatcher negligence. It is interesting to note that one of the most
   significant obstacles to the establishment of prearrival instructions, and medical
   dispatch protocol systems in general, has been the notion that agencies can be


                                                                                          PAG   E   5

                                  successfully sued for engaging in such activities. It appears that there has never
                                  been a dispatcher negligence lawsuit filed for the provision of medically sound
                                  prearrival instructions. There are a significant number of lawsuits recently
                                  completed or in progress for which the omission of prearrival instructions (or
                                  “dispatcher abandonment,” as the legal terminology describes it) has been
                                  alleged.
                                        The nature of prearrival instructions is such that they must be provided in a
                                  timely manner, over the telephone, and without the benefit of practice or visual
                                  verifications. Thus, it is important that EMD’s carefully adhere to protocols for
                                  the provision of telephone-instructed treatment in a standard, nonarbitrary, and
                                  reproducible way.

        asked as to whether the patient is reported to be unconscious and not                to the caller are based on the
        breathing to ascertain if a cardiac arrest has occurred. For example, the            dispatcher’s previous training
        answer "I'm not sure" regarding breathing status given by a second-party caller      in a procedure or treatment
        (someone who can see or easily access the patient) is assumed to mean "no";          but are provided without

                                       Unfortunately, coupled with a growing interest and effort within public
                                 safety agencies to provide some type of telephone instructions to callers, many
                                 agencies are ‘allowing” dispatchers to ad lib instructions. There appears to be a
                                 significant difference between dispatch life support-based prearrival instructions
                                 and telephone aid. Telephone aid, as defined, may only ensure that the
                                 dispatcher has attempted to provide some sort of care to the patient through the
                                 caller but does not ensure that such care is correct, standard, and medically
                                 effective or even necessary in the first place.

         Telephone aid often causes the following predictable errors:
         1. Failure to correctly identify conditions requiring telephone intervention
            and therefore prearrival instructions in the first place (e.g., "saving" an
            infant having a febrile seizure who was incorrectly identified as needing
            CPR due to failure to follow protocols that are medically designed to
            verify need—verify breathing, pulse, etc., before potentially dangerous
            dispatcher-invasive treatments such as compressions are initiated).
         2. Failure to accurately identify the presence of interim symptoms and signs
            (or the lack of them) during the in-progress provision of telephone
            intervention (e.g., dispatchers who ad lib CPR sequences often miss
            important patient verifiers that cannot be seen by the dispatcher, such as
            watching for the chest to rise).
         3. Failure to perform (describe or teach) multistep procedures, such as CPR
            care, in a consistent and reproducible fashion regardless of which
            dispatcher in a center provides such help (e.g., quality assurance review
            of these types of cases often reveals that dispatchers in the same center
            [or even the same dispatcher] perform care differently each time if they
            are not following scripted prearrival instruction protocols closely).
          Telephone aid, as defined, often provides only the illusion of correct help
    via telephone without predictably ensuring consistent and accurate instructions to
    all callers. Telephone aid, therefore, is usually considered an inappropriate and
    unreliable form of dispatcher-provided medical care.
         Medical dispatch practice must be safe, competent, and effective. The
    systematic use of medically preapproved protocols will help to ensure that the
    dispatcher performance is structured and reproducible and can be objectively
    measured.
         In light of the important differences between prearrival instructions and
    telephone aid, and to improve standardization of EMD training and practice, it is
    recommended that:
         • Dispatch life support be adopted nationwide as an essential concept of
           emergency medical dispatch
         • Dispatch life support be standardized
         • Prearrival instructions be provided from written protocol scripts for all
           medical emergencies.



    Medical Dispatcher Training
         Formal EMD training contributes to the safe and effective performance of
    the medical dispatcher’s role in EMS.11
         Guidelines for the core content of EMD courses are currently being
    standardized by the ASTM.19 These guidelines will provide direction for the
    training (and certification) of EMD’s regarding appropriate decisions about EMS
    responses in a safe, consistent, and nonarbitrary manner. Within the context of
    this broad goal, current EMD training is generally at least 24 hours in length (e.g.,
    three 8-hour days). A typical course consists of an overview of dispatching
    objectives and basic dispatch techniques, concentrating on known problem areas.




                                                                                            PAGE   7
A.54                                          APPENDIX I                                       APPENDIX



                  The role of the EMD is defined, and the concepts of medical dispatching are
                  discussed in detail. The medical dispatch protocol in use by the sponsoring EMS
                  agency is learned, with emphasis on interrogation skills, protocol compliance,
                  and the provision of prearrival instructions. Common medical problems are
                  reviewed, with an emphasis on interrogation specifics for each type of problem,
                  and the relevance and relationship of listed prearrival instructions. Throughout
                  the training, the importance of identifying the presence or absence of symptoms
                  (such as “chest pain”) during interrogation is emphasized, rather than making a
                  judgmental diagnosis of “heart attack.” The medical significance of the various
                  levels of urgency for each chief complaint and its resultant response is clarified to
                  give the student the ability to prioritize quickly the various types of incidents
                  confronting EMD’s daily. Often, courses use mock case drills to give the
                  dispatcher a hands-on feel of protocol performance.
                        A formal examination to test student understanding and assimilation of the
                  curriculum should be administered at the completion of an EMD course. This
                  enables formal certification in jurisdictions, requiring or allowing it.6’17'31
                        It is recommended that EMD training:
                        • Be required of all medical dispatchers
                        • Be consistent in core curriculum content nationally

                        • Be based on the medical dispatch protocol selected and approved by the
                          sponsoring agency’s physician medical director, allowing for practice use
                          of the protocol by the EMD trainee.



                  Medical Dispatcher Certification
                         Given the very important role of the dispatcher in the chain of survival,
                  certification should become governmentally mandated throughout the United
                  States6'17,31
                       Certification should include requirements for continuing education and
                  recertification. Continuing education programs should incorporate formal written
                  and practical tests. Continuing education and recertification allow EMS agencies
                  to formally promote and ensure the ongoing quality of EMD performance.
                  Certification also establishes processes for decertifying individuals who cannot
                  meet minimum standards. There have been no studies to determine the optimal
                  frequency or process of recertification; therefore, expert panels have
                  recommended that EMD’s should be recertified every 2 to 4 years.6 At least 12
                  hours per year of continuing education should be required for EMD
                  recertification.20,31
                       It is recommended that EMD certification:

                       • Be required of all EMD’s through either State government processes or
                         professional medical dispatch standard-setting organizations
                       • Require continuing education and recertification as components of a
                         continuing certification process.

    Medical Dispatch Quality Control and Improvement
         Each EMS system should have in place a comprehensive qualitv
    improvement program. Four goals in the quality control and improvement of
    medical dispatch activities are that:

          1. Dispatchers understand medical dispatch policy, protocol, and practice
          2. Dispatchers comply with medical dispatch policy, protocol, and practice
          3. Deficiencies in understanding and compliance with medical dispatch
             policy, protocol, and practice among dispatchers be corrected
         4. Medical dispatch policy, protocols, and practice be updated on a
            continuous basis to ensure that they are appropriate and effective.
         A comprehensive quality control and improvement system for emergency
    medical dispatching has several components. Among these are selection of
    personnel; orientation; initial training; certification and recertification; continuing
    dispatch education; physician medical direction; data generation; case review and
    performance evaluation; correction of performance problems (risk management);
    and decertification, suspension, or termination.32 These components of medical
    dispatcher quality improvement are essential for maintaining the type of
    employment environment necessary to ensure safe and effective patient
    evaluation and care.
          One of the most important areas of quality control/improvement is that of
    case review and performance evaluation.32 Between 7 and 10 percent of each
    EMD’s cases should be randomly reviewed.20 The review of random cases
    ensures that each dispatcher’s current practice (especially compliance with
    protocol) is determined.33 In addition, the review of out-of-the-ordinary cases
    (both excellent and problematic) is important. These cases are often identified by
    sources external to the dispatch center. The involvement of EMS field personnel
    in reporting incidents that appear to represent dispatch-related problems can be
    very helpful in strengthening the performance and policy evaluation process.
         These case reviews should serve as the basis for periodic dispatcher
    performance evaluation. The cumulative level of compliance to protocol of each
    medical dispatcher should be evaluated and compared with preset levels of
    acceptable practice. This provides an objective method of establishing thresholds
    of performance for these essential members of the EMS team. Corrective steps
    may include continuing education or disciplinary action.
         In the absence of adequate case review and performance evaluation, it has
    been shown that dispatcher compliance to protocol deteriorates and is generally
    under 50 percent.34
          Medical direction is an essential element in the overall assurance of quality
    performance of EMD’s. Just as medical direction is uniformly recommended for
    emergency medical technicians and paramedics, the EMD requires careful
    attention and guidance. According to the NAEMSP, ‘The medical aspects of
    emergency medical dispatching and communications are an integral part of the
    responsibilities of the Medical Director of an EMS system. . . .Quality
    Improvement, Risk Management, and Medical Control and Direction are essential
    elements to the management of medical dispatch operations within the EMS
    system.”17

                        It is recommended that ongoing medical dispatch quality control and
                   improvement processes:
                        • Be in place for all medical dispatch centers
                        • Allow for random review of cases
                        • Require high-level compliance to protocol as a major factor in dispatcher
                          performance evaluation
                        • Be the basis of dispatcher reeducation, feedback, discipline, and medical
                          management
                        • Be carried out under the medical direction of a qualified physician.

                                                 EMS team. EMD’s may have a
                                                 profound effect on the early care
                                                 of potential heart attack victims.
                                                                                          SUMMARY

                                                 To ensure optimal emergency
    medical dispatching, this paper has made a number of recommendations, which
    are highlighted below:

         • Each EMS system should utilize a set of written, medically approved
           dispatching protocols for the evaluation of, response to, and provision of
           care to the AMI patient. These protocols should be followed consistently
           and nonarbitrarily by ail EMD’s.

         • Dispatch life support should be provided by each EMS system. EMD’s
           should be required to use medically approved, written prearrival
           instructions to help callers provide aid to the AMI patient and control
           the situation prior to the arrival of EMS personnel.
         • Every EMD should be formally trained, based on a nationally consistent
           core curriculum, with an emphasis on mastery of the dispatching protocol
           used by the sponsoring EMS agency.
         • Certification should be required of all EMD’s, either through State
            governments or professional medical dispatch standard-setting
            organizations. This process should also mandate continuing education
            and recertification.
         • Every EMS system should have in place a system of continuous quality
           improvement for medical dispatching. This should include a random
            review of each EMD’s cases. Periodic performance evaluations should be
            conducted with each EMD, with emphasis on the EMD’s adherence to
            dispatching protocol.
         • All aspects of emergency medical dispatching should be the ultimate
           responsibility of the EMS physician who provides medical direction for a
           given EMS system. That is, an EMS physician should be in an
            authoritative position to manage the medical care components of an EMD
            program, including overseeing training, selecting and approving dispatch
            protocols and prearrival instructions, and evaluating the EMD system.
         These recommendations, if implemented, may result in improvement of
    emergency medical dispatching in general—and potentially better identification
    and treatment of patients with symptoms and signs of AMI, in particular.

       Abstract

       Background: International consensus guidelines now support the use of “chest compressions-only” cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
       instructions (CCOIs) by emergency medical dispatch (EMD) personnel providing telephone assistance to untrained bystanders at a cardiac
       arrest scene. These guidelines are based largely on evolving experimental data and a clinical trial conducted in one venue with distinct emergency
       medical services (EMS) system features. Accordingly, the Council of Standards for th q National Academies of Emergency Dispatch was asked
       to adapt a modified telephone CPR protocol, and specifically one that could be applied more broadly to the spectrum of EMS systems.
       Methods: A group of international EMD specialists, researchers and professional association representatives analyzed available scientific
       data and considered variations in EMS systems, particularly those in Europe and North America.
       Results and conclusions: Several recommendations were established: (1) to avoid confusion, bystanders already providing CPR should
       continue those previously learned methods; (2) following a sudden collapse unlikely to be of respiratory etiology, CCOIs should be provided
       when the bystander is not CPR-trained, declining to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation or unsure of actions to take; (3) following 4 min
       of C COIs, ventilations can be provided, but, tor now, only at a compression-ventilation ratio of 100:2 until EMS arrives; (4) until more
       data become available, dispatchers should follow existing compression—ventilation protocols for children and adult cases involving probable
       respiratory/trauma etiologies; (5) EMD CPR protocols should account for EMS system features and receive quality oversight and expert
       medical direction.

       Recommendations from the Council of Standards of the National Academies of Emergency Dispatch (NAED) regarding dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary
       resuscitation (CPR) instructions provided by emergency medical dispatch (EMD) personnel to bystanders at the scene of a presumed cardiac arrest:

       (1) Bystanders conveying that they or others on-scene are CPR-trained rescuers and therefore not requesting CPR instruction assistance, should
       provide the techniques that they were trained to perform
          To avoid confusion for those bystanders who are actively providing CPR (and not requesting detailed assistance), EMD personnel should reinforce the
       standards that these bystanders were previously taught (e.g., the current 15:2 compression-ventilation ratio or whatever new training guidelines they may have
       received)
          While the Council recommends that trained bystanders perform the techniques they were taught, it also strongly recommends further research into current
       practices, both for children and adults 155,59], given that the preponderance of evidence supports infrequent interruption of chest compressions and suggests
       that a much slower ventilatory rate may be advantageous in pulselessness and severe shock states, even after several minutes of those shock states. Also, if
       bystanders state that they have been previously trained in CPR, but they are still requesting D-CPR instructions because they cannot remember what to do,
       recommendations 2 or 3 (see below) may be applied.


       (2) EMD personnel should provide chest compressions-onlv CPR instructions in the immediate few minutes after a sudden collapse
         When providing protocol-driven dispatch CPR instructions (D-CPR) to untrained rescuers in adult cases of sudden cardiac death (presumably secondary
       to ventricular fibrillation in most cases), there should be omission of mouth-to-mouth ventilation instructions, particularly for the first few minutes following
       the presumed onset of the sudden arrest. Such chest compressions-only instructions also should be given to individuals declining to perform MTMV or those
       unsure of techniques to perform


       (3) Lung inflations should be provided eventually, but infrequently
         Protocol-driven MTMV instructions should eventually be provided to the untrained rescuer after approximately 4 min of CCOIs (or about 400 chest
       compressions). Also, considering the fatigability of the rescuer in performing 400 consecutive chest compressions, the Council recommends that the on-scene
       rescuer should then provide such MTMV breaths after each subsequent cycle of 100 chest compressions (a relatively easy number to count) [57,58]. Specifically,
       afterthe first 400 chest compressions, two rescue breaths shouldbe given and, subsequently, this same 100:2 ventilation to compression ratio should be continued
       until the arrival of EMS responders
         While the Council recognizes the relatively arbitrary nature of these conclusions, based on the best available information and reasonable inferences from
       physiological and experimental data, they provide a relatively logical guide for EMD personnel working in a diversity of settings worldwide. While ratios such
       as 50:2 may be more optimal in certain models [55], a pause every minute may be easier to implement, and it will diminish interruptions of compressions for the
       novice rescuer who may need longer pauses for ventilation. In some respects, the introduction of some breathing after several minutes of cardiac arrest, even
       at a 100:2 ratio, may be considered a more “conservative” approach than the current recommendations for dispatchers which advise chest compressions-only
       instructions (for the untrained rescuer) until professional rescuers arrive. Although the American Heart Association and other international consensus groups
       have not yet changed worldwide standards for compression-ventilation ratios, the preponderance of data appear to support the evolving notion that current
       ventilatory rates are still too frequent, even in the absence of gasping and prolonged periods of arrest


       (4) EMD personnel should provide current rescue breathing—CPR instructions for child and adult cases involving probable respirator) and trauma
       etiologies
         Current rescue breathing (i.e., M fMV) instructions should not be deleted when providing protocol-driven D-CPR instructions to rescuers when the following
       situations can be readily identified: pediatric patients, toxic overdose, hanging or strangulation, drowning, carbon monoxide poisoning, smoke inhalation,
       allergic reactions, severe trauma, and lightning stakes
         While use of CCOIs has been supported in a clinical trial involving adults with sudden cardiac arrest, there still remains a concern that certain populations
       of cardiac arrest patients would benefit more from earlier MTMV. Such patients are those most likely to have presumed pre-arrest hypoxemia and to be already
       hypo-perfused and presumably less likely to be gasping adequately at the time of cardiac arrest [54]. In addition, this special consideration might be given to
       individuals discovered following an unwitnessed event, with presumed prolonged arrest intervals


       (5) D-CPR protocols should account for EMS system features and receive quality oversight and expert medical direction
         Medical direction and quality assurance are key components of EMD and should be an intrinsic aspect of D-CPR protocol implementation and on-going
       quality oversight. D-C PR instructions should account tor system features (e.g., range of response intervals and first-responder capability and training) and
       EMD protocols should be coordinated with response agencies medical directors. In turn, applicable responder and public education should be provided, most
       preferably before EMD protocol implementation
         V bile the purpose of the NAED is to create uniform international standards, it does so by examining and responding to concerns and variations in various

                                      Objectives: To establish the accuracy of the emergency medical dispatcher's (EMD's) decisions to override the
                                      automated Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) logic-based response code recommendations based on
                                      at-scene paramedic-applied transport acuity determinations (blue-in) and cardiac arrest (CA) findings.
                                      Methods: A retrospective study of a 1 year dataset from the London Ambulance Service (LAS) National
                                      Health Service (NHS) Trust was undertaken. We compared all LAS "bluing in" frequency (BIQ) and cardiac

        PRINCIPLES EMD
        S I X T H                          E D          I T I           O      N


         Twenty-eight years ago, the first edition of this book was published,
         defining a new science—Emergency Medical Dispatch—and a
         new link in the EMS chain—the EMD. No longer was radio dispatch
         good enough. Assets were few, mistakes frequent, and public awareness
         growing. The first edition provided the principles for emergency services
         to prioritize calls, provide telephone first aid, and ensure that each caller
         was given the right help, in the right way, and at the right time.

         In this edition, Clawson, Dernocoeur, and Murray redefine how EMD
         should be practiced in modern public safety. Using real-life examples,
         hard-won experience, and humor, the authors discuss the fundamental
         principles underlying successful EMD. The values inherent in careful
         compliance to protocol, increased prioritization, improved quality
         management, and comprehensive application of Dispatch Life Support
         can no longer be questioned.

         With the emergence of managed care, evolving standards, and growing
         public expectation that Pre-Arrival Instructions will be provided,
         understanding the art and science of EMD is absolutely essential.
         Principles of Emergency Medical Dispatch is the key to gaining
         this understanding. Read it, learn it, and apply its principles to create a
         safe, efficient, and effective priority dispatch system.

         As the authors say, It's got to be done right the first time,
         every time.”
